This is just a proof of concept of a one page Progressive Web App (PWA) that can scan a barcode and determine if the product is from EU or not.

You can install it on your phone, and it will run locally. It's based on the QuaggaJS barcode reader.

It's worth noting that a barcode is not a guarantee that it's an EU product. Lots of brands have local barcodes, but hopefully it will give you an idea.
